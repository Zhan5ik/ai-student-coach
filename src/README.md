# Source Code

This folder is intended to contain modular Python components for the project.

Planned modules include:
- model training and inference
- explainability logic
- decision and recommendation rules
- what-if scenario analysis

Currently, the core logic is demonstrated within the research notebook.
The `src` folder represents a future step toward production-level modularization.
