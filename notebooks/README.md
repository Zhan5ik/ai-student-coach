# Notebooks

This folder contains the main research and demonstration notebook for the project.

## student_risk_decision_support.ipynb

This notebook presents the full pipeline of the AI Student Coach system:
- data loading and preprocessing
- academic risk prediction using a logistic regression model
- model explainability with SHAP
- personalized recommendations based on feature contributions
- what-if scenario analysis
- batch prioritization of at-risk students

The notebook is designed to demonstrate the system as a decision-support tool rather than a standalone classifier.
